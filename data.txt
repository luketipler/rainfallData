This file consists of the data that you should use in your Haskell program.

Your program should not process this file directly; rather, it needs to process
a Haskell list containing the data given in this file.

After you have worked out a suitable Place datatype you should include the data
from this file (without any modifications) or additions in your program as a
value of type [Place]; i.e.:

  testData :: [Place]
  testData = [ ... the 14 values values ... ]

This data should be used to demonstrate the correctness of your program in the
in-class demonstration.

If you manage to complete loading and saving of data, make sure that the
testData list value is also stored (without any modifications or additions)
in a places.txt file. Regardless of whether you have implemented a user
interface or loading/saving, make sure that you also complete the demo
function in your program.

The data for each place includes a name, a location expressed in degrees north
and degrees east (almost all degrees east figures are negative since most
places are in the western hemisphere), and a list of 7 daily rainfall figures
for the last week (where the first value is for yesterday and the final value
is for one week ago).
